\abstract{ % \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

Human-Robot Interaction is the field of robotics dedicated to the understanding, design, and evaluation of robotic systems for use by or with humans. Safety is one of the most important aspects this field will have to deal with in the years to come. In this work, pre-contact safety is adressed through the use of an artificial skin developed in our lab that integrates proximiy sensing. Proximity sensor readings are transformed into 3D data, which will later inform the control algorithms. Two different avoidance controls have been implemented: ``A Depth Space Approach to Human-Robot Collision Avoidance'' \cite{flacco2012depth} and ``Collision Avoidance with Proximity Servoing for Redundant Serial Robot Manipulators'' \cite{dingcollision}. The implementations of these two controllers form, with the addition of a third controller that improves upon both of them, a framework for the comparison and improvement of the current state of art in safe robot controllers.

\acknowledgements{	\OnePageChapter	% *MUST* BE ONLY ONE PAGE!
    I would like to acknowledge everyone that played an important role in the completion of my master's degree and this master Thesis. First of all, my parents, without whom nothing I have accomplished woud have ever been possible.

    Secondly, my supervisor Prof. Alessandro Roncone, thank you for giving me the opportunity to work in HIRO and for the patient guidance, encouragement and advice.

    Finally, I must also express my gratitude to my workmate Caleb Escobedo and all of the members of the lab. Thank you for helping me throughout my stay in the United States and for sharing your knowledge.
